# Sentiment Analysis App
This is a simple sentiment analysis API developed using:
* spaCy and spaCyTextBlob
* Flask and Flask-RESTful

I have published an article in Towards Data Science titled [How I Deployed a Sentiment Analyser API with spaCy, Flask and Heroku](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-deployed-a-sentiment-analyser-api-with-spacy-flask-and-heroku-bd9b8f9de6cf#e944-29fa8eb0b743). By completing this tutorial, you will learn to deploy a machine learning model to Heroku using Flask. Therefore, even if you donâ€™t have access to Machine Learning Engineers or Software Engineers at your organisation, you will have the necessary skills to deploy machine learning REST APIs.
